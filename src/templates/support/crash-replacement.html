                Our standard warranty does not apply to damage caused by accidents but, with our Crash Replacement service,
                we can still offer an inexpensive way for our customers to get a new Future kiteboard.<br>
                We will offer you the same or similar kiteboard (without pads, straps, handle and fins) with a 40% discount of the
                original retail price (incl.VAT).
            </h2>
            <p class="support__text">
                Shipping costs are paid by the customer as well as the costs associated with import and customs duties.
                The following offer is valid for two (2) years from the date of purchase on our e-shop <a href="https://futurekiteboarding.com/">www.futurekiteboarding.com</a> and is limited to the original buyer only.<br>
                To be eligible for the Crash Replacement service, you will be required to send us photos of the damaged
                kiteboard as well as the purchase invoice.
            </p>
            <p class="support__text">
                We reserve the right to suspend this service in individual cases if we find that damage has been caused willfully
                and intentionally.
